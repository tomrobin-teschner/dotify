## Introduction

The goal of this program is to take an input from the command line, either by piping the output of a program through
the parser or by listening to the output of a program, and format the output according to specific rules that are
defined through a JSON input file.

## Installation

To compile the parser, simply run

```bash
make
```

and you should be good to go. Note that this requires a C++ compiler that is compatible with the 2014 C++ standard. Or, if you feel a bit adventurous try the following magic lines: 

```bash
meson build && ninja -C build
```

(your future self will thank you for learning meson, honestly! ...). More info: https://mesonbuild.com/Quick-guide.html


## Run

To use the parser on a static text file, you can use the following syntax

```bash
cat textFileToParse | /path/to/parser -f /path/to/inputFile.json
```

Alternatively you can run the parser on the output of a different program to parse its output

```bash
/path/to/programm | tee log | /path/to/parser -f /path/to/inputFile.json
```

## Command line arguments

The following command line arguments are supported

- **-h**,**--help** Prints the help with short description of argumentes and usage
- **-f**,**--file** Path to the `JSON` input file. Without this the parser will effectively just print the text that it
receives.
- **-k**,**--keywordsOnly** Only print string to screen if it contains one of the keywords specified in the `JSON` file.
This is useful if a lot of additional lines are printed that are difficult or cumbersome to suppress through the
`ignoreCompleteLineIfItContainsSubstring` property (see [JSON file explanation](#input-file-for-formatting-text))

## Input file for formatting text

The following shows the basic structure of the input file with simple examples, provided in `JSON` format

```json
{
  "ignoreCompleteLineIfItContainsSubstring" : [
    "should be suppressed"
  ],
  "ignoreContentBetweenDelimiter" : [
    {
      "startingDelimiter" : "<",
      "endingDelimiter" : ">",
      "replaceContentBy" : "..."
    }
  ],
  "styleLineContainingKeywords" : [
    {
      "keyword" : "error",
      "removeDuplicates" : true,
      "applyStyle" : "onKeyword",
      "color" : "red",
      "style" : "bold"
    }
  ]
}
```

Suppose the above is stored as "example.json", consider the following example

```bash
name@pc:~$ printf "This string should be suppressed\nerror when compiling file containing container::data<std::vector<int>, std::vector<double>>\nerror when compiling file conng container::data<std::vector<int>, std::vector<double>>\n" > log
name@pc:~$ cat log
This string should be suppressed
error when compiling file containing container::data<std::vector<int>, std::vector<double>>
error when compiling file containing container::data<std::vector<int>, std::vector<double>>
name@pc:~$ cat log | /path/to/parser -f /path/to/example.json
```

There are 3 sections that can be specified in the input file, which are

- `ignoreCompleteLineIfItContainsSubstring`: In here comes a list of all strings that should be removed from the output.
A string will be removed from the output as long as parts of the string match one of the statements in this list.

- `ignoreContentBetweenDelimiter`: This property defines delimiters which are used to suppress content between those
delimiters. Unlike the `ignoreCompleteLineIfItContainsSubstring` property, this only acts locally on strings between the
delimiter. Furthermore, we can provide two additional arguments `replaceContentBy` and `mustContain`, which provide
fine grained control over the content between the delimiters.
  - `replaceContentBy` defines the string which will be printed instead of the actual content between the delimiters, if
  this entry is not provided, it will default to "...".
  - `mustContain` specifies a string that must be included between the delimiters if the content is to be replaced. This
  is useful if there are several delimiters of the same type but with different content between those. Regular
  expressions are currently not allowed for performance reasons.

- `styleLineContainingKeywords` This list defines keywords and how they should be formatted when printed to screen. In
the above example the keyword is `error`, which should be printed in `red` using a `bold` formatting for the text. A
complete list of allowed entries is as follows:
  - `keyword` This is the keyword to be matched. If the `keyword` is encountered in a string, the line will be formated
  according to the parameters set for this `keyword`.
  - `removeDuplicates` A boolean flag indicating if duplicate entries should be shown or removed from the output. This
  is useful for cyclic dependencies where the same message may be printed more than once. As shown in the example above,
  strings that are identical will not be printed twice if this flag is set to true.
  - `applyStyle` This entry determines how the formatting should be applied to the line, specifically, it determines
  which portion of the string are colored and formatted. The following entries are supported:
    - `preKeyword` Everything before the `keyword` will be formatted.
    - `onKeyword` Only the `keyword` will be formatted.
    - `postKeyword` Everything after the `keyword` will be formatted.
    - `everywhere` Everything (on current line) will be formatted, as long as the string contains the `keyword`.
  - `color` This is the color which the text should take, the following colors are supported:
    - `neutral` (default background color)
    - `red`
    - `green`
    - `yellow`
    - `blue`
    - `magenta`
    - `cyan`
  - `format` This is the formatting that should be applied to the text, the following entries are supported:
    - `normal` (default text formatting)
    - `bold`
    - `dim` (darker than base color)
    - `underline`
    - `blink` (flashing text)

## Example

now let's consider a small but real life example. Suppose we have the following file that we want to put through the
parser:

```
[1/4] Compiling src/foo.cpp
[2/4] Compiling src/bar.cpp
/home/user/project/include/bar.hpp:107: warning: argument 'value' of command @param is not found in the argument list
../include/bar.hpp:120:22: warning: unused variable ‘value’ [-Wunused-variable]
[3/4] Linking lib/libBaz.so
../include/temp.hpp: In instantiation of ‘void myNamespace::myTempClass<myContainerType>::myTempFunction(std::vector<dataContainer> &) const [with dataContainer = myNamespace::dataContainer<std::map<int, std::string>, std::vector<std::array<myArray<double, specialisedDataContainer<std::vector<double>>>>, 3>>]’:
src/temp2.cpp:21:1:   required from here
../include/temp2.hpp:345:23: error: ‘using MyContainer = std::conditional<true, std::vector<double>, std::vector<int> >::type {aka class std::vector<double>}’ has no member named ‘bbegin’
  std::fill(genericContainer.bbegin(), genericContainer.end(), 0.0);
Build failed
  -> task in 'tempProject' failed with exit status 1 (run with -v to display more information)
```

and we have a corresponding input file like so:

```json
{
  "ignoreCompleteLineIfItContainsSubstring" : [
    "is not found in the argument list"
  ],
  "ignoreContentBetweenDelimiter" : [
    {
      "startingDelimiter" : "<",
      "endingDelimiter" : ">",
      "replaceContentBy" : "..."
    }
  ],
  "styleLineContainingKeywords" : [
    {
      "keyword" : "warning",
      "removeDuplicates" : true,
      "applyStyle" : "onKeyword",
      "color" : "magenta",
      "style" : "bold"
    },
    {
      "keyword" : "error",
      "removeDuplicates" : true,
      "applyStyle" : "onKeyword",
      "color" : "red",
      "style" : "bold"
    },
    {
      "keyword" : "Compiling",
      "applyStyle" : "postKeyword",
      "color" : "green"
    },
    {
      "keyword" : "Linking",
      "applyStyle" : "postKeyword",
      "color" : "yellow"
    },
    {
      "keyword" : "Build failed",
      "applyStyle" : "everywhere",
      "color" : "red",
      "style" : "bold"
    },
    {
      "keyword" : "failed with exit status",
      "applyStyle" : "everywhere",
      "removeDuplicates" : true,
      "color" : "red",
      "style" : "bold"
    }
  ]
}
```

Running the above text through the parser using

```bash
user@pc:~$ cat /path/to/logFile | /path/to/parser -f /path/to/inputFile.json
```

will result in the following output:

![Example1](images/example2.png)

We may further wish to suppress clutter by only printing strings that contain keywords. We use the `-k` command line
argument for this. Thus, our command becomes

```bash
user@pc:~$ cat /path/to/logFile | /path/to/parser -k -f /path/to/inputFile.json
```

and our output
